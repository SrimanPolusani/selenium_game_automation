<h1>selenium_game_automation</h1>
<p>This Selenium project automates a game called Cookie Monster. It can buy different upgrades in the game, which have a dynamic price, and takes decisions to buy the highest affordable upgrade at that instance. The program terminates in 5 minutes after printing the achieved cookies per second value. Exception handling is done well, and the program is optimized and balanced to avoid NoSuchElementException errors without much compromise in speed.</p>
<h4>This project is built using Selenium in Python 3</h4>
